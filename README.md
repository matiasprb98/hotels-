This extended project focuses on comparing financial performance, occupancy and average daily rate between city hotels and resorts over several years. It uses SQL for data manipulation and querying, and Power BI for data visualisation.

Project objectives
The main objective is to compare total revenue, occupancy and average daily rate between city and resort hotels over the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, it seeks to determine the desirability of increasing parking availability for both types of hotels according to the season of the year.

Data Used
The expanded project uses the same two main tables as the previous project, which contain information on hotel revenues and occupancy. In addition, a new table recording the average daily rate at each hotel is incorporated.

Analysis Performed
Revenue Comparison between City and Resort Hotels: An analysis was conducted to determine which type of hotel (city or resort) generated the highest amount of revenue in each year from 2018 to 2020.

City and Resort Hotel Occupancy Comparison: The total number of guests staying in city and resort hotels during each year was examined to assess differences in demand and occupancy.

Average Daily Rate Comparison: The average daily rate in both types of hotels was analysed to understand the differences in accommodation prices and their impact on revenue.

Seasonal Parking Needs: Assessed whether there was a need to increase parking availability for city hotels and resorts based on the season of the year and the demand for accommodation. Results and Conclusions The analysis provided detailed insight into the financial performance, occupancy and average rate at city and resort hotels over several years.

Opportunities for improving revenue management and customer experience were identified, as well as the need to adapt facilities, such as car parks, according to seasonal demand.

Next Steps Next steps could include implementing specific strategies to improve profitability and customer satisfaction in city hotels and resorts, as well as exploring other factors that may influence the performance and competitiveness of these establishments. 

This project demonstrates the importance of using data analysis tools such as SQL and Power BI to obtain valuable information to support informed decision making in the hospitality industry.
